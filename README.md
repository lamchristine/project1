# Who's Trippin'? (Project 1)

#####https://whos-trippin.herokuapp.com/

##Summary
#####Who's Trippin'? is a fully CRUD-able posting site for travelers looking for travel companion or to connect with like-minded travelers. All posts are viewable by public; however, to post users will have to create an account and add trips to their post. Trips are editable and deleteable. 

##Technologies Used
MongoDB, Node.js, Mongoose.js, Express.js, Express-session, jQuery, HTML, CSS

##Planned Features
#####1. Due to scope (and time constraints), what started out as a multi-page website is now scaled down to single-page; unfortunately, there wasn't time to reset the index page. 
#####2. Implement Google Maps to map location of trips. 
#####3. Time stamp the posts
#####4. Implement edit functionality for users to update their profile.
